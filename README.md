# Flask-driven Book Search Engine & Recommendation System with HTML CSS, JS, Wikipedia API & Collaborative-Filtering Using KNN
## OVERVIEW
Wanderlust Reads is a Flask-driven book application that uses Wikipedia API for book searching and techniques like Collaborative Filtering using the KNN model for recommendations. It uses HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript for the front end. It also has an add-to-cart and ordering books functionality.

# KEY FEATURES = 
- Automated Dependency Management: Automatically checks and installs missing Python libraries required for the project.
- Book Search Functionality: Allows users to search for books and retrieve relevant content from Wikipedia.
- Spelling Correction: Corrects user input using a spell checker to improve search accuracy.
- Recommendation System: Recommends books based on similarity using a pre-trained K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model.
- Interactive Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.
- Dynamic Content Display: Shows search results, book information, images, and recommendations dynamically.
- Book Order Functionality: The user can add books to the cart, fill out the form, and order the book.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses input data to ensure accurate search results and recommendations.

# Technologies Used
- Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for backend development in Python.
- Python: The core programming language used for backend logic and data processing for search engines and recommendations.
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for initial development and testing of functions and algorithms.
- HTML/CSS: For designing and structuring the front end of the application.
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the front end.
- Wikipedia API: For fetching book information and summaries from Wikipedia.
